**This is just a repo of me trying to learn GoLang with a File Renamer** 

The process of this program is:

1. User types in the Data it needs:
    - First the Directory where the files are located

    - Then the name of the current file that needs to be renamed

    - After that the user types in the New name that he wants

2. After the Data is collected the Program looks through the named directory and scans for the name of the File

3. after the scan it beginns to rename the files to the respective new name that it is given.

<br>
<p>(Just for convenience)</p>
4. Ask if the files should be renamed back
    - just so I dont have to rename them back after each run.

5. In the Future: Add that you could replace the number with "*" to check for every file with the same name but a different number and change the name of them all
